# âœ… Fixed Question Creation Script

## Issue Resolved
The error `column "certification_id" does not exist` occurred because the actual database structure uses:
- `content_items` table connects to `concept_id` (not `certification_id`)
- Relationship: `certifications â†’ domains â†’ concepts â†’ content_items`

## Changes Made
âœ… **Updated table structure** to match actual schema:
- Removed `certification_id`, `domain_id`, `item_type` (don't exist)
- Added `type`, `title` (do exist)
- Fixed all relationship queries

âœ… **Fixed answer choices** to reference questions by `title` instead of `content` text

âœ… **Updated verification queries** to use correct join relationships
