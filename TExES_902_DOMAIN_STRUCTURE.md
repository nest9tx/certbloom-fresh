## üîç **HOW TO GET CONCEPT IDS FOR QUESTIONS**

### **Database Query Pattern:**
```sql
-- Get concept ID for questions
SELECT c.id as concept_id, c.name, d.name as domain_name
FROM concepts c
JOIN domains d ON c.domain_id = d.id  
JOIN certifications cert ON d.certification_id = cert.id
WHERE cert.test_code = '902' 
  AND c.name = '[CONCEPT NAME]'
LIMIT 1;
```

### **Example Queries:**
```sql
-- Place Value concept ID
SELECT c.id FROM concepts c
JOIN domains d ON c.domain_id = d.id
JOIN certifications cert ON d.certification_id = cert.id  
WHERE cert.test_code = '902' AND c.name = 'Place Value and Number Sense';

-- Fractions concept ID  
SELECT c.id FROM concepts c
JOIN domains d ON c.domain_id = d.id
JOIN certifications cert ON d.certification_id = cert.id
WHERE cert.test_code = '902' AND c.name = 'Fractions and Decimals';
```

## üéØ **CONCEPT ASSIGNMENT STRATEGY**

### **Question Distribution Targets:**
- **Domain 1** (Number Concepts): 180 questions (45 per concept)
- **Domain 2** (Patterns/Algebra): 135 questions (34 per concept)  
- **Domain 3** (Geometry): 90 questions (23 per concept)
- **Domain 4** (Data Analysis): 45 questions (11 per concept)

### **Per-Concept Question Mix:**
- **Easy (30%)**: Basic teaching strategies, clear misconceptions
- **Medium (50%)**: Complex scenarios, pedagogical decisions
- **Hard (20%)**: Advanced analysis, integration across concepts

---

## üí° **READY-TO-USE CONCEPT LOOKUPS**

### **Most Common Question Targets:**
1. **Place Value and Number Sense** - Highest priority, most student errors
2. **Fractions and Decimals** - Complex concepts, many misconceptions  
3. **Operations with Whole Numbers** - Fundamental skills, algorithm understanding
4. **Patterns and Sequences** - Algebraic thinking development
5. **Geometric Shapes and Properties** - Spatial reasoning, visual concepts

### **Question Creation Priority Order:**
1. Start with **Domain 1** concepts (40% of exam weight)
2. Build comprehensive banks for **Place Value** and **Fractions** first
3. Add **Domain 2** algebraic thinking questions
4. Complete with geometry and data analysis
