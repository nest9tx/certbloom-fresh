## ðŸ”§ Verified Question Structure Pattern

### Database Schema (Two-Table System)
```sql
-- Main question record
INSERT INTO questions (
    question_text, 
    question_type,
    difficulty_level,
    explanation, 
    cognitive_level, 
    tags, 
    concept_id
) VALUES (
    'Question text here',
    'multiple_choice',
    'medium',
    'Detailed explanation of correct answer',
    'knowledge', -- knowledge|comprehension|application|analysis|synthesis|evaluation
    ARRAY['tag1', 'tag2', 'specific_concept_tag'],
    concept_uuid
);

-- Answer choices (separate table)
INSERT INTO answer_choices (question_id, choice_text, is_correct, choice_order, explanation) VALUES
    (question_id, 'Choice A', FALSE, 1, 'Why this is incorrect'),
    (question_id, 'Choice B', FALSE, 2, 'Why this is incorrect'),
    (question_id, 'Choice C', TRUE, 3, 'Why this is correct'),
    (question_id, 'Choice D', FALSE, 4, 'Why this is incorrect');
```

### Tagging Strategy for Dual Certification
Each question should include tags that serve both purposes:

**Primary Tags**: Core concept identification
- `place_value`, `fractions`, `multiplication`, `patterns`, `geometry`, `data`

**Secondary Tags**: Specific skill identification  
- `digit_value`, `hundreds_place`, `number_sense`, `visual_patterns`, `shape_attributes`

**Cognitive Level Tags**: Bloom's taxonomy alignment
- `knowledge`, `comprehension`, `application`, `analysis`, `synthesis`, `evaluation`

## ðŸ”„ Question Development Workflow

### 1. Question Creation Template
```sql
-- Template for new math questions
DO $$
DECLARE
    question_id UUID;
    concept_id UUID;
BEGIN
    -- Get concept ID (adjust concept name as needed)
    SELECT id INTO concept_id FROM concepts WHERE name = '[CONCEPT_NAME]';
    
    -- Create question
    INSERT INTO questions (
        question_text, 
        question_type,
        difficulty_level,
        explanation, 
        cognitive_level, 
        tags, 
        concept_id
    ) VALUES (
        '[QUESTION_TEXT]',
        'multiple_choice',
        '[easy|medium|hard]',
        '[EXPLANATION]',
        '[knowledge|comprehension|application|analysis]',
        ARRAY['[primary_tag]', '[secondary_tag]', '[specific_tag]'],
        concept_id
    ) RETURNING id INTO question_id;
    
    -- Add answer choices
    INSERT INTO answer_choices (question_id, choice_text, is_correct, choice_order, explanation) VALUES
        (question_id, '[CHOICE_A]', FALSE, 1, '[WHY_INCORRECT]'),
        (question_id, '[CHOICE_B]', FALSE, 2, '[WHY_INCORRECT]'),
        (question_id, '[CHOICE_C]', TRUE, 3, '[WHY_CORRECT]'),
        (question_id, '[CHOICE_D]', FALSE, 4, '[WHY_INCORRECT]');
        
    RAISE NOTICE 'Created question: %', question_id;
END $$;
```

### 2. Quality Standards
- **Authentic Scenarios**: Questions reflect real teaching situations
- **Grade-Appropriate**: Content suitable for EC-6 educators
- **Misconception-Aware**: Distractors target common student errors
- **Cognitive Alignment**: Match intended thinking level
- **Dual Purpose**: Serve both individual Math and EC-6 Core Subjects exams

### 3. Validation Process
1. Test question insertion via SQL
2. Verify concept/domain/certification linking
3. Confirm study path UI display
4. Check adaptive learning compatibility

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights & Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Fresh Start Approach**: Complete cleanup was more effective than migration
2. **Granular Concepts**: 19 specific concepts provide better tracking than 4 broad domains
3. **Two-Table Question Structure**: Separating questions and answer_choices provides flexibility
4. **Comprehensive Tagging**: Multiple tag layers enable sophisticated categorization

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Concept-First Design**: Structure must match UI expectations exactly
2. **Dual Certification Thinking**: Every question must serve both individual and composite exams
3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have fewer, high-quality questions than many mediocre ones
4. **Iterative Testing**: Verify each component before building the next layer

**Status**: âœ… Foundation Complete, Ready for Content Development
**Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 question creation with Place Value Understanding
**Goal**: 450 authentic, well-structured questions serving dual certification needs
