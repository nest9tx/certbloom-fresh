🧠 SMART MASTERY SYSTEM - Fixed Session Repetition Issue

OLD SYSTEM (PROBLEMATIC):
❌ Fixed 20% increase per session regardless of content
❌ Always required exactly 5 sessions to complete
❌ Ignored content amount and user performance  
❌ Poor user experience with repetitive sessions

NEW SYSTEM (ADAPTIVE):
✅ Mastery based on content richness and performance
✅ Rich content (4+ questions): Complete in 1-2 sessions  
✅ Medium content (2-3 questions): Complete in 2-3 sessions
✅ Light content (1 question): Complete in 3-4 sessions
✅ First session always gets at least 40% progress

MASTERY CALCULATION:
📊 Rich Content (4+ items):
   - Session 1: +70% mastery (MASTERED if reaches 80%+)
   - Session 2: +30% mastery (guaranteed completion)

📊 Medium Content (2-3 items):  
   - Session 1: +50% mastery
   - Session 2: +30% mastery (likely mastered at 80%+)
   - Session 3: +30% mastery (guaranteed completion)

📊 Light Content (1 item):
   - Session 1: +40% mastery (minimum learning curve)
   - Session 2: +30% mastery  
   - Session 3: +30% mastery (mastered at 100%)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
🎯 "Adding and Subtracting Fractions" (rich content): Should complete in 1-2 sessions
🎯 "Place Value Understanding" (medium content): Should complete in 2-3 sessions  
🎯 Concepts with single explanations: Will still require multiple reviews for retention

USER EXPERIENCE:
✅ More content = faster completion (rewards richer learning)
✅ Prevents endless repetition of same 2 questions
✅ Still ensures concepts are properly learned and retained
✅ Progress feels more natural and achievement-based
