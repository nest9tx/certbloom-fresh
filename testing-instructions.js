🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS - Session Completion Fix

WHAT WAS FIXED:
✅ Fixed data property mismatch (concept_progress vs user_progress)
✅ Enhanced debugging for progress tracking  
✅ Made handleConceptComplete async with better error handling

TEST SCENARIO:
1. 🎯 Go to study path dashboard (should show 0% progress)
2. 🎯 Click "Adding and Subtracting Fractions" 
3. 🎯 Complete all the questions in the concept
4. 🎯 Return to dashboard
5. 🎯 Should now show "1 of 10 concepts mastered" and 10% progress

WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN CONSOLE:
📊 "Calculating overall progress..."
📊 "Found 10 total concepts"  
🔍 "Progress for Adding and Subtracting Fractions" (should show progress data)
📊 "Overall progress calculated: { completed: 1, total: 10, percentage: 10 }"

IF IT STILL SHOWS 0%:
1. Check browser console for the debug logs above
2. Look for any error messages in the console
3. Verify the progress data is being loaded correctly

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
✅ Dashboard should reflect completed concepts immediately
✅ Progress bar should fill to 10% 
✅ Concept should show as mastered with checkmark
✅ Save/resume functionality works automatically via database
