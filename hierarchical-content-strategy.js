🎯 SMART CONTENT STRATEGY: Hierarchical Question Tagging

BRILLIANT OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFIED:
✅ Questions for Math EC-6 (902) should ALSO count toward EC-6 Core Subjects (391)
✅ Same for ELA (901), Science (904), Social Studies (903), Fine Arts (905)
✅ Build once, use in multiple certification paths!

CURRENT TEXES STRUCTURE:
📋 TExES Core Subjects EC-6 (391) = Comprehensive exam covering:
   ├── Mathematics (902 content)
   ├── English Language Arts (901 content)  
   ├── Science (904 content)
   ├── Social Studies (903 content)
   └── Fine Arts, Health & PE (905 content)

SMART TAGGING STRATEGY:
🏗️ Every question gets DUAL certification assignment:
   📊 Primary: Specific test (902 Math, 901 ELA, etc.)
   📊 Secondary: Core Subjects (391)

EXAMPLE:
Question: "What is 3/4 + 1/8?"
✅ Primary: TExES Core Subjects EC-6: Mathematics (902)
✅ Secondary: TExES Core Subjects EC-6 (391) 
✅ Topic: "Number Concepts and Operations"

IMPLEMENTATION:
🛠️ Database Schema Enhancement:
- Keep certification_id as primary certification
- Add secondary_certification_ids ARRAY field
- Questions automatically appear in both exams

🛠️ Admin Interface Enhancement:
- When creating Math questions, auto-tag for both 902 AND 391
- Content Overview shows shared questions correctly
- Progress tracking works for both certification paths

MASSIVE EFFICIENCY GAINS:
📈 Build 450 Math questions → Serves BOTH 902 AND 391 users
📈 Build 400 ELA questions → Serves BOTH 901 AND 391 users  
📈 Build 350 Science questions → Serves BOTH 904 AND 391 users
📈 Result: 1,550 questions serve 8 different certification paths!

USER EXPERIENCE:
👤 User studying for 391 (Core Subjects):
   → Gets ALL math, ELA, science, social studies questions
   → Comprehensive preparation across all domains
   
👤 User studying for 902 (Math only):
   → Gets ONLY math questions from the same pool
   → Focused preparation for specific subject

UPDATED TARGET DISTRIBUTION:
📊 Mathematics (902 + 391): 450 questions
📊 English Language Arts (901 + 391): 400 questions  
📊 Science (904 + 391): 350 questions
📊 Social Studies (903 + 391): 350 questions
📊 Fine Arts/Health/PE (905 + 391): 250 questions
📊 Total: 1,800 questions serving 6 certifications!
