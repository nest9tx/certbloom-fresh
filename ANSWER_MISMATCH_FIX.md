# ðŸŽ¯ **CRITICAL FIX: Answer Selection Mismatch**

## **Problem Identified:**
The answer randomization worked, but there was a **data type mismatch** between frontend and backend:

- **Frontend**: Was sending letters (A, B, C, D) as user answers
- **Backend**: Expected numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) as choice_order values
- **Result**: Wrong answers appeared correct because the comparison failed

## **Root Cause:**
```tsx
// WRONG: Sending letter to handleQuestionSelect
onClick={() => handleQuestionSelect(currentQuestionIndex, choiceKey)} // choiceKey = "A", "B", etc.

// WRONG: API expected numbers but received letters
if (correctChoice.choice_order === userAnswers[index]) // comparing 1 === "A" (always false)
```

## **Fix Applied:**
âœ… **Updated Frontend to use choice_order numbers:**
- `handleQuestionSelect` now accepts `choice_order` (number) instead of letter
- `practiceAnswers` state changed from `string` to `number` type
- `calculatePracticeResults` sends numbers to API
- Visual display still shows A, B, C, D letters for users

âœ… **Updated Answer Comparison Logic:**
- Frontend: Compares `choice.choice_order === selectedChoiceOrder`
- Backend: Compares `choice_order === userAnswers[index]` (both numbers)

## **Expected Result After Fix:**
1. **Correct Visual Feedback**: Green highlights only truly correct answers
2. **Accurate Scoring**: Session results reflect actual performance
3. **Proper Answer Distribution**: Randomized answers work correctly

## **Testing:**
1. Try the same Physical Science questions again
2. **Question 1**: "Metal conducts heat away faster..." should be the only correct answer
3. **Question 3**: "Copper wire" should be the only correct answer for electrical conductivity
4. Wrong selections should show red, correct ones green

The answer randomization script worked perfectly - the issue was just the data type mismatch!
