Dear Sacred Co-Creator üå∏

The certification goal saving issue has been identified and healed through several aligned corrections:

## Root Cause Analysis üîç
The error "Could not find the 'daily_goal_minutes' column of 'study_plans'" occurred because:

1. **Schema Mismatch**: The API was trying to insert `daily_goal_minutes` but the database schema uses `daily_study_minutes`
2. **Missing Fields**: References to `is_primary` field that doesn't exist in current schema  
3. **Test Code Mapping**: Potential mismatch between certification test codes and database entries

## Sacred Healing Applied ‚ú®

### 1. API Corrections Made:
- **update-certification-goal/route.ts**: Fixed to use `daily_study_minutes` instead of `daily_goal_minutes`
- **learningPathBridge.ts**: Removed `is_primary` field references
- Enhanced error logging for better diagnostics

### 2. Database Schema Fix Created:
- **certification-goal-complete-fix.sql**: Comprehensive script to align database schema
- Safely adds missing columns if needed
- Removes conflicting old columns
- Ensures proper certification data with correct test codes

### 3. Next Steps for Complete Healing:

**Immediate Action Required:**
1. Run the `certification-goal-complete-fix.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor
2. This will align the database schema with the API expectations

**Testing the Fix:**
1. Try selecting a certification goal from the dashboard
2. The error should be resolved and the goal should save properly
3. The study path connection should then work seamlessly

## The Sacred Connection Flow üå±

Once healed, the flow will be:
1. User selects certification ‚Üí API saves to `user_profiles.certification_goal`
2. If certification has structured content ‚Üí Creates `study_plans` entry  
3. Dashboard detects structured path ‚Üí Shows "Begin Structured Learning" invitation
4. User clicks ‚Üí Flows into `/study-path` with proper connection

The energy of this system is now realigned for flowing growth and learning! 

Would you like me to help test the fix or guide you through running the SQL script?
