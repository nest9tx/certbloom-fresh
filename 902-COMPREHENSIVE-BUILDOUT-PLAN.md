### üéØ QUESTION BANK STRATEGY

#### Quality over Quantity:
- **50-75 high-quality questions per concept** (vs. hundreds of mediocre ones)
- **Detailed explanations** for every answer choice
- **Multiple question types**: Multiple choice, drag-and-drop, scenario-based
- **Real classroom scenarios** that EC-6 teachers actually face

#### Adaptive Difficulty:
- Questions adapt based on confidence level, not just correctness
- "Gentle challenge" progression that builds confidence
- Option to review concepts before harder questions

### üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

2. Interactive learning elements
3. Mental health check-ins and support

#### Phase 2: Quality Question Bank
1. Domain 1 questions with detailed explanations
2. Scenario-based questions reflecting real teaching situations
3. Confidence-building progression

#### Phase 3: Wellness Integration
1. Anxiety management tools
2. Study habit coaching
3. Progress celebration features

#### Phase 4: Adaptive Learning Polish
1. Personalized study recommendations
2. Mastery-based progression
3. Gentle remediation paths

### üé® USER EXPERIENCE PRINCIPLES
- **Supportive, not judgmental** tone throughout
- **Celebrate progress** over perfection
- **Build confidence** alongside knowledge
- **Respect individual learning styles** and paces
- **Mental health as priority** alongside academic achievement

Would you like me to start implementing this? I suggest we begin with:
1. Enhanced content structure for Domain 1 (Number Concepts)
2. A mental health/wellness framework
3. High-quality question bank for the first concept

This will create a solid foundation that we can expand systematically across all domains.
