# AI Collaboration Guide: TExES Question Creation for CertBloom
**For AI Assistant Partners**  
**Mission:** Create authentic TExES exam questions that prepare future teachers for real classroom challenges

## üéØ Your Role & Objectives

You are helping create **authentic Texas Teacher Certification (TExES) exam questions** for CertBloom, a platform that funds educational pods in the Four Corners region. Your questions must:

1. **Test pedagogical knowledge**, not just content knowledge
2. **Feature realistic classroom scenarios** with named teachers and specific student situations
3. **Include sophisticated distractors** that address common teaching misconceptions
4. **Maintain TExES exam authenticity** in tone, complexity, and focus

## üìã Required Question Format

### Question Structure
Each question must include:
- **Realistic scenario** (2-3 sentences with classroom context)
- **Clear question stem** asking for best pedagogical response
- **4 answer choices** (A, B, C, D) with one clearly correct answer
- **Explanation for correct answer** (2-3 sentences explaining why)
- **Brief explanations for incorrect choices** (1 sentence each explaining why wrong)

### Quality Standards
- **Grade-level appropriate** scenarios (EC-6, 4-8, or 7-12)
- **Authentic teacher names** (Ms. Rodriguez, Mr. Chen, Mrs. Thompson, etc.)
- **Specific student behaviors** or learning situations
- **Focus on teacher decision-making** and instructional strategies

## üéì Content Priorities (EC-6 Core Subjects Focus)

### Reading/Language Arts (High Priority)
Create questions about:
- **Comprehension strategies** (students decode but don't understand)
- **Phonological awareness** (syllable segmentation, rhyme recognition)
- **Reading behaviors** (substitution patterns, cueing systems)
- **ELL support** (cultural context, figurative language)
- **Balanced literacy** (component emphasis by grade level)

### Mathematics (High Priority)
Create questions about:
- **Error analysis** (systematic student mistakes in calculations)
- **Number sense** (estimation strategies, flexible thinking)
- **Misconceptions** (fraction comparisons, place value errors)
- **Problem-solving approaches** (multiple solution strategies)
- **Concrete-to-abstract** progression in concept development

### Science (Medium Priority)
Create questions about:
- **Inquiry-based learning** (student investigation methods)
- **Misconception identification** (common student science errors)
- **Safety protocols** (lab procedures, demonstration safety)
- **Scientific method** (hypothesis formation, data collection)

### Social Studies (Medium Priority)
Create questions about:
- **Primary source analysis** (age-appropriate document interpretation)
- **Geographic reasoning** (map skills, location analysis)
- **Historical thinking** (cause-and-effect relationships)
- **Civic engagement** (community connections, citizenship concepts)

## üìù Template Examples to Follow

### Template 1: Error Analysis (Mathematics)
**Scenario:** "Ms. [Name] observes a [grade] student consistently making the following error: [specific mathematical mistake with example]. The student shows their work: [student's incorrect process]. This error pattern suggests..."

**Question:** "Which instructional approach would be most effective for addressing this issue?"

**Answer Choices Pattern:**
- A. [Surface-level fix that doesn't address root cause]
- B. [Correct pedagogical approach addressing conceptual understanding] ‚úì
- C. [Common but inappropriate intervention]
- D. [Well-meaning but misdirected strategy]

### Template 2: Reading Behavior Analysis
**Scenario:** "During [specific reading context], a teacher observes that a student [specific reading behavior with example]. This behavior most likely indicates..."

**Question:** "What does this suggest about the student's reading development?"

**Answer Choices Pattern:**
- A. [Misinterpretation of the behavior]
- B. [Correct analysis of underlying reading process] ‚úì
- C. [Oversimplified diagnosis]
- D. [Unrelated reading skill assumption]

### Template 3: Instructional Decision-Making
**Scenario:** "[Teacher name] wants to [specific pedagogical goal] for her [grade] students. She is considering which [instructional approach/strategy] would be most effective for [specific learning context]."

**Question:** "Which approach would best support this goal?"

**Answer Choices Pattern:**
- A. [Developmentally inappropriate strategy]
- B. [Correct evidence-based approach] ‚úì
- C. [Popular but ineffective method]
- D. [Misaligned with stated goal]

## üéØ Specific Content Requests

### Phase 1: Reading Comprehension (Need 15 questions)
Create variations of these scenarios:
1. **Decoding vs. Comprehension** - Students who decode well but struggle with meaning
2. **Comprehension Strategy Instruction** - Teaching students to summarize, infer, connect
3. **Reading Behavior Analysis** - Substitution patterns, self-correction strategies
4. **Text Complexity Considerations** - Matching texts to reader development
5. **Assessment of Reading Skills** - Identifying specific reading strengths/needs

### Phase 2: Mathematical Thinking (Need 12 questions)  
Create variations of these scenarios:
1. **Multiplication Error Patterns** - Systematic mistakes in algorithms
2. **Fraction Misconceptions** - Whole number thinking applied to fractions
3. **Number Sense Development** - Estimation vs. procedural thinking
4. **Problem-Solving Strategies** - Multiple approaches to mathematical reasoning
5. **Place Value Understanding** - Common errors and instructional responses

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Requirements

### Must Include
- **Teacher names and specific grade levels**
- **Detailed student behaviors or work samples**
- **Pedagogically sound correct answers**
- **Realistic classroom contexts**
- **Texas education terminology and standards**

### Must Avoid
- **Generic "a teacher" scenarios**
- **Abstract theoretical questions**
- **Trick questions or wordplay**
- **Multiple correct answers**
- **Content knowledge only (without pedagogical context)**

## üìä Delivery Format

Please provide questions in this exact format:

```
QUESTION [Number]:
[Full scenario and question]

A. [Choice A text]
B. [Choice B text]  
C. [Choice C text]
D. [Choice D text]

CORRECT ANSWER: [Letter]
EXPLANATION: [2-3 sentences explaining why this choice is correct]

DISTRACTOR EXPLANATIONS:
A. [Why this is incorrect]
B. [Why this is incorrect - skip if this is correct answer]
C. [Why this is incorrect]
D. [Why this is incorrect]

DIFFICULTY: [easy/medium/hard]
COGNITIVE LEVEL: [comprehension/application/analysis/evaluation]
TAGS: [relevant teaching concepts, comma-separated]
```

## üåü Success Indicators

Your questions are successful when they:
1. **Feel authentic** - Could appear on actual TExES exam
2. **Test teaching knowledge** - Require pedagogical reasoning, not just content recall
3. **Include realistic details** - Specific grade levels, student names, classroom situations
4. **Have clear correct answers** - Based on research-backed teaching practices
5. **Challenge misconceptions** - Distractors address common teaching errors

## üéØ Getting Started

**Recommended First Batch:** Create 5 questions about reading comprehension strategies using the error analysis and instructional decision-making templates. Focus on elementary scenarios (grades K-3) where students can decode but struggle with understanding.

Remember: These questions will help future teachers succeed in their certification and ultimately serve children in classrooms. Quality and authenticity are paramount!
