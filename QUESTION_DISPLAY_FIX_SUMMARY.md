# Question Display Fix - Root Cause Found and Fixed! 

## 🔍 **Root Cause Discovery**

The issue was **NOT** about question linking, but about **data structure mismatch**:

### Problem:
- **ContentRenderer** (used in study paths) was trying to access `question.answer_a`, `question.answer_b`, etc.
- **These columns don't exist** in the database! (Error: `column q.answer_a does not exist`)
- **Practice Session** works because it uses `question.answer_choices` array from the `answer_choices` table

### Why Math 902 "worked":
- Math 902 wasn't actually working in the **study path** - only in the **practice session**
- You were testing different flows: study path (broken) vs practice session (working)

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

### 1. Updated Question Interface
```typescript
export interface AnswerChoice {
  id: string
  question_id: string  
  choice_text: string
  is_correct: boolean
  choice_order: number
  explanation?: string
}

export interface Question {
  // Removed: answer_a, answer_b, answer_c, answer_d
  // Added: answer_choices array
  answer_choices?: AnswerChoice[]
}
```

### 2. Updated getQuestionsForConcept()
Now loads questions WITH answer_choices:
```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  answer_choices(*)
`)
```

### 3. Fixed ContentRenderer Display
Changed from:
```typescript
// OLD - doesn't exist
{ key: 'A', text: currentQuestion.answer_a }
```

To:
```typescript
// NEW - uses answer_choices table
{currentQuestion.answer_choices?.map((choice) => (
  <button key={choice.choice_order}>
    {String.fromCharCode(64 + choice.choice_order)}) {choice.choice_text}
  </button>
))}
```

### 4. Fixed Answer Checking Logic
Now checks correctness via `answer_choices.is_correct` instead of comparing to `correct_answer` field.

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After this fix:
- **All certifications** (901, 902, 903, 904, 905) should display real answer choices
- **No more empty A), B), C), D) options** 
- **Study path questions work the same as practice session questions**

## 📋 **Testing Steps**

1. Navigate to any certification's study path
2. Click on a concept  
3. Click "Practice Questions"
4. Verify you see real answer text instead of empty choices

The fix addresses the architectural mismatch between study path and practice session question handling!
