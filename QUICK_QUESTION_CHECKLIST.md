## ‚úÖ **PRE-CREATION CHECKLIST**

### **Answer Choice Distribution Planning**
- [ ] Plan which questions will have correct answer in A, B, C, D positions
- [ ] Ensure 25% distribution across all positions (5 A's, 5 B's, 5 C's, 5 D's per 20 questions)
- [ ] Vary answer length intentionally - don't make correct answers always longest

### **Difficulty Planning** 
- [ ] 30% Easy (Difficulty 1-2): Basic teaching strategies
- [ ] 50% Medium (Difficulty 3): Complex scenarios  
- [ ] 20% Hard (Difficulty 4-5): Advanced analysis

## üìù **DURING CREATION - EACH QUESTION**

### **Scenario Requirements**
- [ ] Specific teacher name (Ms. Rodriguez, Mr. Chen, etc.)
- [ ] Exact grade level mentioned
- [ ] Concrete classroom situation described
- [ ] Student behavior/work sample included

### **Answer Choice Quality**
- [ ] All 4 choices are plausible teaching approaches
- [ ] Only 1 choice is clearly best based on research
- [ ] Choices vary in length naturally (no patterns)
- [ ] No identical phrases across different questions

### **Content Focus**
- [ ] Tests HOW to teach, not WHAT to teach
- [ ] Addresses specific misconception or teaching decision
- [ ] Correct answer reflects best pedagogical practice
- [ ] Scenario feels authentic to real classroom

---

## üîÑ **BATCH REVIEW - EVERY 5 QUESTIONS**

### **Pattern Check**
- [ ] Correct answers spread across A, B, C, D (not clustering)
- [ ] Answer lengths vary - some short correct, some long correct
- [ ] No repeated answer choices between questions
- [ ] Different teacher names used

### **Quality Check**
- [ ] Each question requires teaching knowledge to answer
- [ ] Scenarios feel like real TExES exam questions
- [ ] Difficulty distribution on track
- [ ] Various math concepts covered
