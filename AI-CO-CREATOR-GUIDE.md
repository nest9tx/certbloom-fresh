## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### **Dual-Certification Tagging System**
```sql
-- Every question gets both primary and secondary certification
PRIMARY: certification_id (specific subject exam: 902, 901, 904, etc.)
SECONDARY: secondary_certification_ids ARRAY (includes 391 for all)

-- Efficiency Result:
-- 1,750 questions serve 8 different certification paths!
```

### **Database Schema Requirements**
```sql
-- Questions must include:
certification_id UUID,              -- Primary exam (902, 901, etc.)  
secondary_certification_ids UUID[], -- Secondary exams (always includes 391)
topic_id UUID,                      -- Subject area within certification
question_text TEXT,                 -- Full scenario and question
difficulty_level TEXT,              -- easy, medium, hard
explanation TEXT,                   -- Why correct answer is right
cognitive_level TEXT,               -- analysis, application, evaluation, etc.
tags TEXT[]                         -- Searchable teaching concepts
```

COGNITIVE LEVEL: Analysis
DIFFICULTY: Medium to Hard
TAGS: student_misconceptions, assessment_analysis, [subject-specific]
```

### **Template 2: Instructional Strategy Selection**
```
