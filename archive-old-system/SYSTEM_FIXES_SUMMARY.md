# Critical Fixes Applied

## 🔧 Issues Identified:
1. **Wrong Table Usage**: APIs were using `questions` table instead of `content_items`
2. **Answer Format Mismatch**: Frontend sending letters (A,B,C,D), backend expecting numbers (1,2,3,4)  
3. **Foreign Key Issues**: Wrong relationship between tables

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. API Route Fix (`/api/complete-session/route.ts`)
- ✅ Changed from `questions` table to `content_items` table
- ✅ Fixed answer comparison logic to use choice_order numbers 
- ✅ Added debugging logs to track question processing
- ✅ Updated foreign key relationship to use `content_item_id`

### 2. Question Loading Fix (`src/lib/conceptLearning.ts`)  
- ✅ Changed `getQuestionsForConcept()` to use `content_items` table
- ✅ Added proper answer_choices relationship
- ✅ Fixed foreign key to use `content_item_id`

### 3. Frontend Fix (ContentRenderer.tsx)
- ✅ Already fixed to use choice_order numbers internally
- ✅ Visual display still shows A, B, C, D for users
- ✅ State type correctly uses numbers

## 🚨 Remaining Issues to Test:
1. **Math 902 pulling Science questions** - Need to verify content categorization
2. **Answer correctness** - Need to test with actual questions

## 🧪 Next Steps:
1. Test the application with both Math 902 and Science 902
2. Verify answer scoring works correctly
3. Check question categorization is accurate
4. Run database diagnostics to ensure data integrity

## 🔍 Database Checks Created:
- `comprehensive-system-diagnosis.sql` - Full system check
- `check-answer-choices-structure.sql` - Table relationship verification
- Multiple diagnostic scripts for content verification
