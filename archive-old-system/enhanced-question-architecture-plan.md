- Pricing page â†’ StaticNavigation (public access)  
- Dashboard/authenticated pages â†’ Navigation (auth-aware)
- Build process working for production deployment

### Next Phase: Dual-Certification Question System

## ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Question Design Pattern**

### **For Math/EC-6 Example:**
```
PRIMARY CERTIFICATION: TExES Core Subjects EC-6: Mathematics (902)
SECONDARY CERTIFICATION: TExES Core Subjects EC-6 (391)
DOMAIN: Number Concepts and Operations
CONCEPT: Place Value Understanding
```

**Question serves BOTH:**
- Math EC-6 (902) candidates â†’ Focused math preparation
- Core Subjects (391) candidates â†’ Comprehensive exam coverage

### **Database Enhancement Needed:**
```sql
-- Add to existing questions table
ALTER TABLE questions 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS secondary_certification_ids UUID[] DEFAULT '{}';

-- Auto-tagging trigger for efficiency
-- Math (902) questions automatically tagged for Core Subjects (391)
```

## ðŸŒ¸ **Enhanced Content Flow Architecture**

### **Phase 1: Study Mode (Concept Learning)**
```
User Journey:
1. Select Certification Goal
2. Choose Domain (Number Concepts, Reading Strategies, etc.)
3. Study Concept Materials (explanations, examples, strategies)
4. Verify Understanding (3-5 practice questions per concept)
5. Progress to Next Concept (mastery-based progression)
```

**Content Types per Concept:**
- **Text Explanation** (5-8 minutes) - Core understanding
- **Interactive Example** (3-5 minutes) - Hands-on application  
- **Teaching Strategy** (4-6 minutes) - Pedagogical approach
- **Practice Questions** (8-12 minutes) - Mastery verification

### **Phase 2: Exam Simulation Mode (Test Preparation)**  
```
User Journey:
1. Select "Practice Test" 
2. Choose Test Length (20, 30, or 50 questions)
3. Take Randomized Exam (from full question bank)
4. Review Performance (question-by-question analysis)
5. Identify Study Areas (concept gaps highlighted)
```

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation Strategy**

### **Question Creation Pattern:**
Each question includes:
```javascript
{
  // Core Question Data
  question_text: "Ms. Rodriguez notices her 3rd grade students...",
  primary_certification_id: "math_ec6_902",
  secondary_certification_ids: ["core_subjects_391"],
  
  // Pedagogical Context
  domain: "Number Concepts and Operations",
  concept: "Place Value Understanding", 
  cognitive_level: "application",
  difficulty_level: "medium",
  
  // Rich Metadata
  tags: ["place_value", "student_misconceptions", "instructional_strategies"],
  explanation: "This response demonstrates...",
  rationale: "Other options are incorrect because...",
  
  // Adaptive Learning Support
  prerequisites: ["number_recognition", "base_ten_concepts"],
  related_concepts: ["decimal_place_value", "rounding_strategies"]
}
```

### **Content Creation Workflow:**
1. **Concept Mapping** â†’ Identify learning objectives per domain
2. **Study Materials** â†’ Create explanations, examples, strategies
3. **Question Bank** â†’ Build exam-realistic practice questions
4. **Dual Tagging** â†’ Ensure questions serve multiple certification paths
5. **Quality Assurance** â†’ Verify pedagogical authenticity

## ðŸŽ“ **Question Quality Standards**

### **TExES Authenticity Requirements:**
- **Realistic Scenarios** â†’ Named teachers, specific grade levels, actual classroom situations
- **Pedagogical Focus** â†’ Teaching decisions, not just content knowledge
- **Student-Centered** â†’ Based on student behaviors, work samples, learning needs
- **Research-Based** â†’ Correct answers reflect best teaching practices

### **Example Question Pattern:**
```
SCENARIO: "Ms. Chen's 2nd grade class is working on place value. 
When asked to represent 247 with base-ten blocks, several students 
show 2 hundreds, 4 tens, and 7 ones, but then say the number is 
'twenty-four seven.' What is Ms. Chen's best next instructional step?"

A. Have students practice counting by tens and hundreds
B. Explicitly connect the visual representation to verbal number naming âœ“
C. Assign more practice worksheets with place value problems  
D. Move on to three-digit addition since they understand the blocks

EXPLANATION: Students demonstrate place value understanding with 
manipulatives but need explicit connection between visual and verbal 
representations. This bridges the gap between conceptual and 
procedural understanding.
```

## ðŸ“Š **Content Development Targets**

### **Year 1 Question Bank Goals:**
- **Math EC-6**: 450 questions (serves both 902 and 391 users)
- **ELA EC-6**: 400 questions (serves both 901 and 391 users)  
- **Science EC-6**: 350 questions (serves both 904 and 391 users)
- **Social Studies EC-6**: 300 questions (serves both 903 and 391 users)
- **Fine Arts/Health/PE**: 250 questions (serves both 905 and 391 users)

**Total Impact**: 1,750 questions serving 8 different certification paths!

### **Efficiency Multiplier:**
- **Build once, serve multiple paths** = Maximum ROI on content creation
- **Adaptive learning** = Personalized preparation for each user
- **Concept mastery** = Deep understanding, not just test passing

## ðŸŒ± **Implementation Timeline**

### **Immediate (This Week):**
1. âœ… Apply database schema enhancements for dual certification tagging
2. âœ… Create first 5 authentic Math EC-6 questions using the established pattern
3. âœ… Test dual-certification functionality (questions appear for both 902 and 391)

### **Phase 1 (Next 2 Weeks):**
1. Build 25 high-quality Math questions across key concepts
2. Create study materials (explanations, examples) for 5 core concepts  
3. Connect concept learning flow to question bank practice
4. Implement study mode vs. exam simulation mode selection

### **Phase 2 (Month 1):**
1. Expand to 100 Math questions covering all major domains
2. Begin ELA question development (targeting reading and writing pedagogy)
3. Polish adaptive learning recommendations between concepts
4. Add performance analytics and progress visualization

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Metrics**
