    - Practice: Probability experiments

16. **Personal Financial Literacy**
    - Explanation: Income, expenses, saving, spending
    - Examples: Budgets, interest, loans
    - Practice: Financial planning scenarios

## Phase 2: Enhanced Question Database & Mastery System

### Question Bank (Per Concept)
- **12-15 questions per concept** (192-240 total questions)
- **Difficulty Levels**: 4-5 Easy, 4-5 Medium, 4-5 Hard
- **4 answer choices each** with varied correct answers (A, B, C, D distribution)
- **Anti-gaming features**: Randomized selection, answer shuffling, time limits
- **TExES-style formatting** and scenarios

### Improved Mastery Criteria
**MASTERY ACHIEVED when ALL of these are met:**
1. **Accuracy**: 80%+ correct on minimum 8 questions
2. **Consistency**: 3+ consecutive correct answers
3. **Learning Time**: 5+ minutes on explanation/example content  
4. **Difficulty Span**: Questions from easy, medium, and hard levels
5. **Anti-Gaming**: Minimum time per question, no rapid clicking

### Current System Issues Fixed
- ‚ùå **Time-only mastery** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Performance + time + comprehension**
- ‚ùå **Gameable clicking** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Genuine understanding required**  
- ‚ùå **Too few questions** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Robust question bank**
- ‚ùå **No difficulty progression** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Adaptive difficulty**

## Phase 3: Interactive Features
- **Progress tracking** for each concept
- **Mastery indicators** (3 correct in a row = mastered)
- **Adaptive recommendations** (which concept to study next)
- **Time tracking** and analytics

## Implementation Priority
1. **Start with Domain 1** (Number Concepts) - most fundamental
2. **Build one complete concept** as a template
3. **Scale to all 16 concepts** 
4. **Add question database**
5. **Test complete user journey**

Would you like me to start by building out the first concept (Place Value and Number Sense) as a complete template that we can then replicate for the other 15 concepts?
