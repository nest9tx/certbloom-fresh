-- Remove Duplicate Content Items and Establish Clean Question Flow
-- This addresses the duplicate fraction questions issue

-- Step 1: Remove duplicate manually-inserted content that conflicts with database questions
DELETE FROM content_items 
WHERE title IN (
    'Practice: Adding Fractions with Like Denominators',
    'Practice: Adding Fractions with Unlike Denominators - 1/3 + 1/6', 
    'Practice: Subtracting Fractions - 3/4 - 1/4'
) 
AND type = 'practice_question'
AND content->>'question' IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 2: Clean up any other duplicate content items by title and type
WITH duplicates AS (
    SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY concept_id, title, type ORDER BY created_at) as rn
    FROM content_items
)
DELETE FROM content_items 
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM duplicates WHERE rn > 1
);

-- Step 3: Update the database function signature to match what the code expects
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS handle_content_engagement_update(UUID, UUID, INTEGER, NUMERIC);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS handle_content_engagement_update(UUID, UUID, INTEGER);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_content_engagement_update(
    target_user_id UUID,
    target_content_item_id UUID,
    time_spent INTEGER
