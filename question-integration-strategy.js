🎯 QUESTION BANK INTEGRATION STRATEGY

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE:
📚 content_items (Learning Phase): 2-5 explanations/examples per concept
🎯 questions (Practice Phase): 64 → 1,850 exam-style questions

PROBLEM:
❌ Study path only uses content_items (learning materials)
❌ Questions table (exam practice) not integrated into study flow
❌ Users repeat same 2-5 learning items instead of practicing varied questions

RECOMMENDED INTEGRATION:

🏗️ PHASE 1: Enhanced Study Flow
1. Learning Phase → content_items (explanations, examples)
2. Practice Phase → questions table (filtered by concept/domain)
3. Mastery Phase → challenging questions from questions table

🏗️ PHASE 2: Question Pool Connection
1. Link questions table to concepts via domain mapping
2. Filter questions by:
   - certification_id (Math EC-6)
   - topic_id (maps to concept)
   - difficulty_level (foundation/application/advanced)

🏗️ PHASE 3: Adaptive Practice Sessions
1. Start with foundation questions
2. Progress to application questions based on performance
3. Unlock advanced questions as mastery increases
4. Pull from 450 Math EC-6 questions (not just 2-5 items)

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

✅ IMMEDIATE (Today):
1. Map current concepts to question topics in admin dashboard
2. Create domain mapping: "Adding and Subtracting Fractions" → topic_id
3. Test pulling questions from questions table in study flow

✅ SHORT TERM (This Week):
1. Build 50-100 questions for "Adding and Subtracting Fractions"
2. Integrate question randomization into ConceptViewer
3. Create practice session that pulls from question bank

✅ MEDIUM TERM (Next 2 Weeks):
1. Build out full Math EC-6 question bank (450 questions)
2. Implement adaptive difficulty progression
3. Add performance analytics to guide question selection

EXPECTED USER EXPERIENCE:
🎯 Concept: "Adding and Subtracting Fractions"
   - Learning: 3-5 content_items (explanations)
   - Practice: 20-30 varied questions from questions table
   - Mastery: 10-15 challenging questions before completion

🎯 Exam Simulation Mode:
   - Full practice tests pulling from entire 450-question Math EC-6 bank
   - Mirrors actual TExES exam format and rigor
   - Adaptive difficulty based on performance

TRACKING & ADMIN:
📊 Admin dashboard shows:
   - Content items per concept (learning materials)
   - Questions per topic (practice bank)
   - Total progress toward 1,850-question goal
   - Performance analytics per concept

This creates a true exam preparation system, not just concept learning! 🎯
