## Execute the 902 Structure Script

Since we can't execute the SQL script directly through Node.js without additional setup, please:

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**:
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/aqxdbizfulpdmajhvedy/sql
   
2. **Copy the entire contents** of `create-proper-902-structure.sql`

3. **Paste and execute** in the SQL Editor

4. **Verify success** by checking that the script completes without errors

### âœ… Add Missing Columns to content_items
