🔍 CURRENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS - Issues Identified

PROBLEM 1: QUESTION CATEGORIZATION MISMATCH
❌ Old questions categorized for previous system
❌ All questions dumped into "General Education" (62 questions)
❌ New concept-based system doesn't match old question structure
❌ Question format may have changed during schema updates

PROBLEM 2: INEFFICIENT STUDY FLOW
❌ Mixed learning + testing in same session (confusing)
❌ Hardcoded content that doesn't scale with spreadsheet imports
❌ Explanation → Question → Explanation (interrupts testing flow)
❌ Doesn't mimic actual exam experience

PROBLEM 3: REPETITIVE SESSIONS
❌ Same session content on infinite repeat
❌ No progression or variety
❌ Poor user experience and learning outcomes

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: SEPARATE STUDY & PRACTICE MODES

📚 STUDY MODE (Concept Learning):
✅ "What's covered in this section" overview
✅ Explanations, examples, refresher content
✅ Quick concept check questions
✅ Completion when concepts are understood

🎯 PRACTICE MODE (Exam Simulation):
✅ Pure question bank without interruptions
✅ Mimics actual TExES testing experience
✅ Adaptive difficulty based on performance
✅ Pulls from domain-specific question pools

🔄 STUDY FLOW REDESIGN:
1. Select Domain: "Number Concepts and Operations"
2. Study Mode: Learn concepts with explanations
3. Ready Check: Short quiz to verify understanding
4. Practice Mode: 20-50 exam-style questions
5. Performance Review: Identify weak areas
6. Return to Study Mode if needed
