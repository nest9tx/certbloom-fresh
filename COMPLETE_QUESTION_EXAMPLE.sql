    'Mrs. Rodriguez notices that her third-grade student Elena consistently writes "three hundred five" as 3005 instead of 305. When asked to explain, Elena says, "I hear three-hundred so I write 300, then I hear five so I write 05." Which intervention would BEST help Elena understand correct place value representation?

A. Have Elena practice writing numbers in expanded form (300 + 5 = 305)
B. Give Elena worksheets with more number writing practice  
C. Use base-10 blocks to build 305 while saying "three hundreds, zero tens, five ones"
D. Show Elena the correct answer and have her copy it five times',
    'C',
    'Multi-sensory instruction with manipulatives helps students connect concrete representations to abstract notation.',
    'Option C is correct because Elena''s error shows she doesn''t understand that zero serves as a placeholder in the tens position. By using base-10 blocks while verbalizing "three hundreds, zero tens, five ones," Elena can see and hear that the zero holds the tens place when there are no tens. This multi-sensory approach (visual blocks + auditory reinforcement) addresses her specific misconception about place value positions and the role of zero as a placeholder.',
    'In classroom practice, always use manipulatives when students show place value confusion. Have them build numbers with blocks, say each place value aloud, then write the digits. This concrete-to-abstract progression prevents common place value errors.',
