# üéØ CertBloom Question Creation Handoff Guide
## TExES 902 Math EC-6 Excellence Standards

*For AI Assistants, Content Creators, and Quality Review*

---

## üö® **CRITICAL QUALITY STANDARDS** 

### ‚ùå **AVOID THESE COMMON MISTAKES** (Learned from Past Experience)
1. **Same Answer Choices**: Never reuse identical answer options across questions
2. **Predictable Patterns**: Don't always put correct answer in position B or C
3. **Length Bias**: Correct answers should NOT always be longer/more detailed than distractors
4. **Generic Scenarios**: Avoid "A teacher wants to..." - use specific names and contexts
5. **Content-Only Focus**: Questions must test TEACHING knowledge, not just math knowledge

---

## üìã **ESSENTIAL REFERENCE FILES**

### **Before Creating Questions - Review These:**
1. **`TExES_902_DOMAIN_STRUCTURE.md`** - Complete domain/concept mapping with IDs
2. **`COMPLETE_QUESTION_EXAMPLE.sql`** - Working code example for AI to follow
3. **`QUICK_QUESTION_CHECKLIST.md`** - Quality control checklist

---

## ‚úÖ **REQUIRED QUESTION FORMAT**

### **Database Structure** (Use this exact format)
```sql
INSERT INTO content_items (
    id, concept_id, type, title, content, correct_answer, explanation,
    detailed_explanation, real_world_application, confidence_building_tip,
    common_misconceptions, memory_aids, anxiety_note, difficulty_level,
    estimated_time_minutes, topic_tags, cognitive_level, learning_objective,

## üîó **HOW TO TIE QUESTIONS TO DOMAINS/CONCEPTS**

### **Step 1: Choose Your Concept**
Reference `TExES_902_DOMAIN_STRUCTURE.md` for complete concept list:
- **Domain 1** (Number Concepts): Place Value, Operations, Fractions, Proportional Reasoning
- **Domain 2** (Patterns/Algebra): Patterns, Expressions, Equations, Functions  
- **Domain 3** (Geometry): Shapes, Measurement, Coordinates, Transformations
- **Domain 4** (Data Analysis): Data Collection, Statistics, Probability, Financial Literacy

### **Step 2: Get Concept ID**
```sql
-- Copy this pattern for any concept
SELECT c.id as concept_id
FROM concepts c
JOIN domains d ON c.domain_id = d.id  
JOIN certifications cert ON d.certification_id = cert.id
WHERE cert.test_code = '902' 
  AND c.name = '[EXACT CONCEPT NAME FROM STRUCTURE GUIDE]'
LIMIT 1;
```

### **Step 3: Use Complete Working Example**
- Reference `COMPLETE_QUESTION_EXAMPLE.sql` for exact code format
- Follow the 3-step process: Get ID ‚Üí Insert Question ‚Üí Add Answer Choices
- Use identical SQL structure for consistency

---

## üéØ **DIFFICULTY LEVEL DISTRIBUTION**

### **Target Mix Per Concept** (15-20 questions)
- **Difficulty 1-2 (Easy)**: 30% (5-6 questions)
  - Basic teaching strategies
  - Fundamental misconceptions
  - Clear pedagogical choices

- **Difficulty 3 (Medium)**: 50% (8-10 questions)  
  - Complex classroom scenarios
  - Multiple valid approaches to compare
  - Common teaching dilemmas

- **Difficulty 4-5 (Hard)**: 20% (3-4 questions)
  - Sophisticated error analysis
  - Advanced pedagogical reasoning
  - Integration across multiple concepts

---

## üîÑ **ANSWER CHOICE ROTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Correct Answer Distribution** (Per 20 questions)
- **Position A**: 5 questions (25%)
- **Position B**: 5 questions (25%)
- **Position C**: 5 questions (25%)  
- **Position D**: 5 questions (25%)

### **Answer Choice Length Guidelines**
- **Vary length intentionally**: Some correct answers short, some long
- **Balance across positions**: Each position gets mix of lengths
- **Avoid patterns**: Don't make A always short, D always long
- **Natural variation**: Length should serve clarity, not hint at correctness

### **Example Balance:**
```
Question 1: A (short, correct), B (long), C (medium), D (medium)
Question 2: A (long), B (medium), C (short, correct), D (medium)  
Question 3: A (medium), B (medium), C (long), D (short, correct)
```

## üìö **CONTENT REQUIREMENTS**

### **Scenario Elements** (Every Question Must Include)
- **Specific Teacher Name**: Ms. Rodriguez, Mr. Chen, Mrs. Williams, etc.
- **Grade Level**: "third-grade class," "her 4th graders," "kindergarten students"
- **Concrete Context**: Actual classroom situation, student work sample, or teaching decision
- **Pedagogical Focus**: Decision about HOW to teach, not WHAT to teach

### **Bad Example** ‚ùå
```
A teacher wants to help students understand fractions. Which approach is best?
A. Use manipulatives
B. Draw pictures  
C. Practice worksheets
D. Explain the concept
```

### **Good Example** ‚úÖ
```
Ms. Chen notices her third-grade student Marcus can recite "three-fourths" 
when shown 3/4 but says "four-thirds" when shown 4/3. Which intervention 
would best address this specific misconception?

A. Have Marcus practice reading more fraction symbols aloud
B. Use pie charts to show Marcus that 4/3 means "four pieces, each one-third size"  
C. Give Marcus worksheets with fraction identification practice
D. Teach Marcus to always read the bottom number first
```

## üí° **MISCONCEPTION PATTERNS TO ADDRESS**

### **Common Student Errors** (Build questions around these)
1. **Place Value**: Adding extra zeros (305 ‚Üí 3005)
2. **Fractions**: Thinking larger denominator = larger fraction
3. **Multiplication**: Forgetting to regroup in multi-digit problems
4. **Problem Solving**: Focusing on keywords instead of understanding
5. **Decimals**: Treating decimals like whole numbers

### **Common Teaching Mistakes** (Include as distractors)
1. **Procedure over Understanding**: Teaching algorithms without concepts
2. **Generic Feedback**: "Try again" instead of specific guidance
3. **One-Size-Fits-All**: Same approach for all learning styles
4. **Rushing to Abstract**: Skipping concrete and pictorial stages
